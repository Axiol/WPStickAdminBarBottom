This is a simple code which does what it need to do : it put the Wordpress Admin bar to the bottom.

It works with Wordpress 3.3 and the sub-menus work too.


## Installation

Grab the code and paste it in the `functions.php` of your theme. Which is in `wp-content/themes/YourTheme/functions.php`

### Optional

Uncomment the little commented part if you want the admin bar to go to the bottom even in the Admin Section.
